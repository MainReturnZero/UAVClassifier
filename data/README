This folder contains all the data we process. Some are originally captured from wireshark, some are processed by our script to filt unrelated data out.
1. channel_search***.pcap/.json files are the sample data we capture from channel 1-11, I just tried to see if any obvious pattern or difference between different channel.
2. If the name is with 'lab', that data is collected in Lab, otherwise, the data is collected while the drone is flying. 
3. All files end with 'data' is filtered data that only contains payload of udp packet
