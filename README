A brief documentation about each script file:

bin.py:
    This file contains a bin class. Each bin object is a container for a set of packet with same characteristics. You can define this characteristics by yourself.

capture.py:
    This file is a class that contains different capture options using wireshark. For example, you can define if you want to capture in monitor mode, you can capture with certain MAC address, or you can specify the file name you want to save your captured data to.

constant.py:
    This file collect WiFi standard constant data, for example, the probe request frame is 4.

json_data_parser.py:
    This file is a class of a packet object. This object is a structure of a Wifi packet, it contains:
            _packet_size
            _time_stamp
            _time_delta
            _type
            _type_subtype
            _mac_time
            _signal
            _channel
            _sa
            _da
            _ssid
            _data
    The class can read in a formatted wifi packets JSON file, and convert it into a list of Packets object. In this way, you can simply call the object instant to get the value you want for each packet.
    If you want to do packet analysis, you are very likely to add function in this file since you can get each field of a WIFI packet directly after reading a JSON file.
    You can run your function by substitute the function name in '__main__'

observer.py:
    This file contains a oberver class. You can think it as a monitor for a specific field of a packet. For example, if you want to monitor the signal strength changing for a sequence of packet, you can define you observor as signal_strength.

plot.py:
    This file is a wrap of pyplot to visualize the data we want to analysis.

search_channel.py:
    This file search channel 1-11 to see if there is any potential drone data we want to monitor.

system_call.py:
    This file deals with system call. For example, call wireshark to capture a certain set of Wifi packets. If you have system dependent error when running this application, it is very likely that it is caused by the system call. Potentially, if you run it on windows, you want to modify the system calls adapting to the Windows OS.
